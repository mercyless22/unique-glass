For the **short description (GitHub repo tagline)**, you can use:  

**“Responsive business website for Unique Glass Rajkot, built with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, AOS, and EmailJS.”**  

Do you want me to also create a **generic screenshot placeholder pack** (with labels like “Homepage”, “About”, etc.) so you can drop them in until you capture the real ones?
```
